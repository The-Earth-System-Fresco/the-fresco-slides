BATCH 1

The universe is more than a whole: it is the content and the container.
No one knows exactly how the universe is determined.

Recently, theories lean in favor of a "big bounce", a cyclic cosmological model, imagining regular expansions ("bangs") and contractions ("crunches") of the latter, for example.

What is there, since when, in what forms and under what conditions?
This is the challenge of research: knowing what we are. And this is our only acceptable limit...

In any case, everything starts from there!

THE "BIG BANG"

BATCH 1
2
The Big Bang is currently the prevailing cosmological model and is used by scientists to describe the origin and evolution of the current Universe.
It describes its abrupt change from a stable, compact and limited state to another, expanding.

The term appeared, depending on the considerations, between 1922 (Alexandre Friedmann) and 1927 (Georges Lemaître). It was in 1965 that this concept of sudden cooling and expansion from an extremely dense primordial epoch was established, along with the discovery of the cosmic microwave background, "the vanished brilliance of the formation of worlds" (Georges Lemaître).

It is here, for us and our current universe, in any case, that everything begins, 13.8 billion years ago...

If we consider the appearance of the lineages that gave rise to the appearance of man, we have to go 20, 16 and especially 7 million years back in time to find the main genetic evolutions characterizing it.

A social, bipedal, opposed-thumb land mammal, the current branch of natural selection, homo sapiens (us), has remarkable encephalization (a development of a part of the brain called the neocortex), allowing to go far beyond their ancestral abilities, notably to be conscious.

These morphological and neurological characteristics allowed it to go beyond the simple crude and opportunistic use of its environment.

No need for a Godwin point, but a reminder: when humans do not perceive the systemic limits of their society, they have historically looked for scapegoats and turned to the worst, observations having shown similar behaviors in non-human animals. History already has many proofs that humans have no real limit...

In this gradation of destabilization, institutions, politics (the polis city, its politeia constitution and its politikos citizens), services, even the foundations of society can be shattered. It is enough for the viability to drop, for the pollution to become too strong, for the material resources (recycled or not) or energy to run out for the immense Ponzi scheme that is the global, capitalistic market economy, to collapse.

When effects related to the dynamics of complex systems get involved, when there is too much pollution, when viability decreases, when all the dependencies fail in cascade, when recycling is no longer sufficient to compensate for mining depletion, overshoot can appear (very) abruptly, and counter-intuitively…

The ecological or environmental footprint is an indicator and a method of evaluation that takes into account the pressure exerted by men on natural resources and the "ecological services" provided by nature.

It measures the productive food surfaces of land and water necessary to produce the resources that an individual, a population or an activity consumes and to absorb the waste generated, taking into account the techniques and the management of the resources in force.

This surface is expressed in global hectares (gha), that is to say in hectares with a productivity equal to the average productivity. It is currently exploding, since technical progress continues to bring new things, the rebound effect amplifies the phenomenon, which the increase in population also entails.

Since man appeared on Earth, it has never ceased to draw on its resources. From the first carved stone wheels, eligible stone supplies were depleted on the surface, but the trees used for huts and fire grew back.

Agriculture, industry, trade, fishing, energy, buildings, deforestation, mining, leisure, transport, residence,… They are too numerous to list, but each activity requires energy and matter.

And by an effect that Raymond Kurzweil calls "the law of accelerated returns", each gain brings its share of progress, in scientific knowledge, as in uses, increasing all the more future progress, and diversifying activities (feedback loop) .

As far as we can go back, and since the elements have formed more and more complex molecules and thanks to the presence of water, we tracked the oldest forms of life on our planet to 4.28 billion years ago.

Life is defined by the fact of being able to reproduce identically, the ability to maintain certain physico-chemical parameters, a metabolism and the molecular memory constituted by heredity.

It was after polymerization of the elements of the Earth primordial soup that life was able to develop and meet these criteria. The process of creation of living things from the inert is called abiogenesis. The elements necessary for known life are CHNOPS (Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Phosphorus, Sulphur), although the first 4 may have sufficed for a time.

Human activities involve the use of elements present in the environment, these uses lead to experience, and experience leads to an optimization of these uses.

In return, knowledge accumulates, technical improvement too, and we invent, manufacture, produce more and more means, which, again, make it possible to produce more and more, with better quality, but also faster and more at the same time.

Over time, we go through cycles of interest, growth, saturation and then decline of what we invent, produce and then forget. This progress generates new uses.

Each year, the Global Footprint Network produces a new edition of its national ecological footprint accounts. These calculate the ecological footprint and biocapacity of more than 200 countries and territories from 1961 to the present day.

Earth Overshoot Day is the day when humanity has exhausted the Earth's natural resources for the current year. The rest of the year being considered as a life on credit that draws on the planet's stocks of non-renewable resources.

9 planetary boundaries have been established by Johann Rockström and his team to characterize this overshoot. In 2022, it was estimated on July 28, for 1.75 planet Earth on December 31 (2.77 gha/inhab against 1.58 gha/inhab).
More than half of these 9 limits have already been crossed.
Note that the more this limit is exceeded, the more the biocapacity falls in cascade, leading to a decline in viability on Earth, pollution, mining exhaustion, all in a complex system where everything is meshed and where recycling cannot compensate for everything. …

Human activities lead to ideas, ideas lead to research, research leads to discoveries, discoveries lead to the accumulation of knowledge, science, which in turn leads to new technologies, and these technologies are made progress, an improvement in our standard of living and uses.

From the verb scire (to know) in Latin, science designates the discovery, accumulation and transmission of knowledge. As soon as humans were able to formalize their knowledge, they were able to accumulate and transmit it, which nevertheless moves by leaps and bounds: scientific paradigms.

As for what we discover, it is up to us to know what to do with it and how to use it for the best... Gaston Bachelard wrote: "Reality is never what we might believe, but it is always what we should have thought."

CREATION OF THE SUN AND ITS SURROUNDINGS
11

11
The sun, our star, that of our planetary system, was formed 4.603 billion years ago, when the dust of our universe began to collapse on itself, forming stars, probably following from the explosion of an adjacent supernova forming a disk of soon-to-merge material.

It is located 150 million kilometers from Earth, an ideal distance and converging condition for the appearance of life. It measures 14 million kilometers in diameter (109 times the diameter of the Earth), and accounts for 99.8% of the matter of our planetary system (333,000 times the mass of the Earth), which is however modest for a star.

From its surface, the photosphere, at 5,000°C, to its core, at 27 million degrees Celsius, it only exists because it is a confined thermonuclear fusion reactor, regulated by a subtle balance between attraction (strong nuclear interaction) and repulsion (nuclear Coulomb force), plus a quantum chance called the tunnel effect allowing it to brew 620 million tons of hydrogen… Per second. And to send us a fraction of its radiation, which nevertheless represents 99.99% of the energy we receive.

The Earth, our as celestial object, was created 4.567 billion years ago, from the collapse of the solar nebula, the cloud of gas from which the Solar System was formed, long before welcoming life.

Its history is divided into 4 major eras, called "eons": Hadean, Archean, Proterozoic and Phanerozoic. This stormy story has seen it go through radically different states: mass of gas, accretion of matter, covered in molten rock, mass extinction, saturated with oxygen or carbon at lethal rates, and so on. Before becoming the planet we perceive today… And our only known place of life.

It is attributed several stacked "layers": atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, geosphere, pedosphere, lithosphere, biosphere, and even the magnetosphere.

APPEARANCE OF SEDIMENTS AND FOSSILS

13
A fossil is essentially the mineral trace of an ancient living organism, and therefore has existed since the latter appeared. Most fossil fuel deposits derive from the organic matter of living beings incorporated into the sediments during their deposition (a kerogen). It can be continental or not.

	For organic matter of continental origin, the sedimented debris is mostly vascular plants, therefore rich in lignin, but also soil organic matter during significant leaching. They are deposited in marshy environments or deltaic floodplains. This sedimentation and preservation in the sediments is at the origin of the coal deposits consisting mainly of coal.

For the organic matter of oceanic origin, these are essentially organisms of planktonic origin to which can be added wind deposits (spores, pollens) coming from the continent.

These organic materials evolve giving rise to hydrocarbons of the oil (petroleum) and gas type, under the effect of burial, sometimes resulting from plate tectonics, and therefore from heat and underground pressure (pyrolysis).

The laws and principles of physics constrain us, to say the least...

Upwards, human beings have managed to go -via the Apollo 13 mission- up to 140,000 kilometers from their place of life, and the Voyager 1 probe is currently our most distant object, 23.6 billion kilometers away from Earth. In 2017, 37 years after being launched, it still responded, and its thrusters were reactivated ever so slightly, soon running out of energy, continuing its one-way journey into the unknown.

Downwards, man managed to descend to 3,900 meters underground, in the deepest mine in the world, at 10,911 m via robots under the ocean (at 1071 times the pressure of the surface) and 12,262 m below the Kola Peninsula, Russia.

In terms of speed, if you wanted to go as far as possible, the fastest human object ever recorded remains the Parker probe, brushing against the Sun at less than 8 million kilometers altitude, at the speed… Of 532,000 km/h, which is 1/2028th of the speed of light in vacuum.

As far as we can see, the Earth is an insignificant dust in the universe. And the human being has… Only a tiny layer 20 kilometers thick of living space on its surface, the biosphere: the equivalent of a thickness of cellophane covering a basketball.

FOSSIL GAS
15

15
Fossil gas is formed when kerogens are buried deeper and deeper. It can be found alone, but also and often associated with oil, or coal (the gases will be different). When these become more deeply buried, by increasing the heat and the pressure, in the end, only gas is obtained.

It is the gas (natural and fossil, therefore) which is partly responsible for the primary migration (expulsion from the bedrock where it is formed), then secondary (along the permeable layers) towards the surface.

Fossil gas currently represents 24% of the current global energy consumption mix, for 22% of greenhouse gas emissions. It is the energy of power plants that are easy to build and operate, of cooking and of distributed central heating.

Its peak extraction should happen somewhere between 2020 and 2070, it may have already passed. We would have about 50 to 60 years of fossil gas left, 150 with unproven but supposed reserves.
FOSSIL GAS
BATCH 2

FOSSIL COAL
16

16
Fossil coal is classified using physico-chemical criteria according to the successive stages of transformation, known as coalification, which was reached during carbonification: the peat stage designates coals that have not been or have been very little buried, we can still recognize plant remains there with the naked eye. Next come the lignite, subbituminous coal, bituminous coal, then anthracite stages, in order of increasing coalification. It is pyrolyzed again to make coke. It was formed 65 to 350 million years ago, most of it… During the Carboniferous, the epoch to which it gave its name.

Coal currently represents 27% of energy consumption in the world, and 40% of the generation of greenhouse gases, making it the first source in the world. It represents about 2 TW of power, for 1/3 of the world's electricity. Despite this, around 300 new coal power plants will be opened between 2021 and 2026.

Its peak of exploitation is expected to be somewhere between 2050 and 2150, and there are something between 130 and 400 years of coal left, at the current rate of extraction. 8 countries hold and produce 90% of the coal resources used.
FOSSIL COAL

FOSSIL OIL
17

17
Oil is irreplaceable. All fossil fuels have their advantages, but oils are light, energy-dense, do not wear out, are easy to transport, to store (a 2-tonne vehicle can be satisfied with a 70-litre tank for hundreds of kilometers). It was formed between 20 and 350 million years ago.

Being the most widely used energy in the world, it is the absolutely decentralized energy, of transport, but also of petrochemicals, two absolutely vital axes of our modern life, and very slightly for heating. Its use derives above all from social interests generated by the military (highways, aviation) or private industrialists (individual car, daily commute). Today, cutting oil literally means stopping the world: its use is the base of everything, especially globalization. And there is still no emerging substitute to it.

Oil accounts for 33% of the global energy consumption mix, for 34% of greenhouse gas emissions. There would be approximately 30 to 60 years of oil remaining in proven reserves, not much more counting assumed reserves. It can be conventional (like acne being drilled into the ground) or unconventional (like a caesarean section of the latter). The extraction of the first has already passed a peak between 2007 and 2008, the peak of extraction for all oils combined is expected between 2025 and 2030.

NUCLEAR ENERGY
18

18
Civil nuclear energy is only used in 32 countries out of 195. Irradiation by ionizing radiation (about 25 accidents in history) being invisible, it has a bad reputation in certain countries, and its related deaths (about 90/PWh against 1,400/PWh for hydroelectricity, or even 100,000/PWh for coal) make it one of the least lethal sources in the world (3 major accidents), but one of the most feared and delicate, in addition to being very low carbon and minimal for land use and pollution.

Nuclear energy can be fission (currently used) or fusion (at prototype state, such as the ITER project), in all cases it uses elements that have been forged in stars following stellar nucleosynthesis . Fission produces around a million times more energy than other common uses of redox (fossil fuels, biomass, etc.), fusion generating another 2 to 3 times more. It represents 4.5% of the global energy consumption mix (440 reactors).

Only problem to it: for fission needs the largest atoms that can reasonably be found on Earth (Uranium and Thorium), and fusion needs the smallest atoms that can be found: hydrogen. In both cases, unstable isotopes (of altered number of neutrons) are preferred: 2H (deuterium), 3H (tritium, essentially synthetic), fissile like 235U, or fertile (convertible to fissile): 232Th, 238U.

At the current rate, the peak of uranium 235 extraction is expected in the decades to come, with between approximately 60 and 100 years of reserves left. 130 times more for uranium 238, and 3.3x more for thorium. Which would make between 250 and 1000 years of energy with a global mix of 100% fission nuclear energy, on condition that we switch to 4th generation power plants (currently only a handful in the world).
Civil fusion power energy, on the other hand, removes all the minor drawbacks of fission energy, but won't be ready until around 2080.

RESOURCES TOO LOWLY RENEWABLE

19
Resources that are too weakly renewable are those on which we can only temporarily count, if we ever decide to exploit them.

Oil, gas and fossil coal are among these resources that are too weakly renewable: they take several million years to be created, and we deplete them in a few decades.

All these resources are therefore subject to a modeling of the extraction curve as presented by the geophysicist Marion King Hubbert in 1956, characterized by two essential points: it has a bell shape, therefore passing through a maximum and declining sharply through the suite, and it is often relatively symmetrical with respect to this maximum…
RESOURCES TOO LOWLY RENEWABLE
BATCH 2

IRREVERSIBLE RESOURCES
20

20
It will always be possible to synthesize the chemical elements we would wish for and which do not come from an external baryogenesis. Since 1936 (Technetium) and until 2010 (Tennessine), we have never stopped synthesizing some that hardly existed any more or even not any more on Earth. But this requires far too many resources, and remains very marginal.

Basically, this means that when the two most fissile elements relatively found on Earth (Uranium and Thorium) have all been split in reactors and transformed into other atoms, there will be none left.

On the other hand, when we send matter towards space, as long as it stays there, it is lost and goes beyond our limits.

Finally, let's not forget (fortunately) that the energy balance of the Earth is neutral, even if it is unbalanced by climate change, and that the energy received by the Sun definitely goes away again and makes the Earth, despite everything … Heating space.

RESSOURCES FORTEMENT RENOUVELABLES
21

21
Knowing that hunting and fishing (wildlife) leads almost systematically to ecological disturbances, and knowing that the breeding of animals, domestic or not, can pose major problems of resource balance (between 20 and 15,000 liters of water used per kilogram of beef depending on the location of the world, for example), in addition to speciesist ethical problems, it is complicated to assess the quality of these resources.

On the other hand, plant resources, mosses, mushrooms, can be used, and even be beneficial to extract in certain cases outside regulation. Provided you do not abuse it: in France, for example, in 1820, the country fell to 12% of its territory covered in forest, a sad and dangerous historical minimum saved in extremis… By coal.

These biotic resources are part of the resources on which we can count… Since this is how living systemics things works: to create living from inert matter, then from dead living matter (we are made of atoms from millions of times dead organisms). As long as the ecosystems that carry them remain intact and that we do not exceed their capacity for renewal...

It is impossible to know when the first stars actually formed. We know how to observe galaxies supposed to be more than 13 light-years away at a constant distance… Which is very close to the historical limits of the Big Bang.

After the dark age, a period when matter was so present that light stumbled everywhere on it, it is assumed that the universe most likely saw the first galaxies form between 300 and 500 million years after its own formation.

The first clusters would have arrived after 1 billion years, and the first superclusters after 3 billion years. Ours, called "Laniakea" ("the immense skies" in Hawaiian), modeled in 2014 for the first time, would include no less than 100,000 galaxies, like ours, which still in turn contain hundreds of billions of stars and at least as many planets each.

POLYMERIZATION

Primitive metabolism would have started in water on the surface of minerals. Simple atoms were made up of simple molecules. Simple molecules have formed more complex molecules. When small molecules react with each other to form higher molecular weight ones, this is called polymerization.

At a given stage of our world, molecules have evolved into metabolites, carbohydrates, amino acids, from nuclides to more complex RNA (ribonucleic acids) and DNA, then membrane lipids, allowing cells to separate genome (nucleus) and metabolism (cytoplasm), i.e. to maintain life, reproduce, react to the environment and above all… To develop. Life could then appear.

After the appearance of life on Earth, the latter has never ceased to flourish, live, die, reproduce and begin again, in turn producing increasingly complex, diverse and rich biotic resources.

Several cycles can be distinguished: physico-chemical cycles, which are called geochemical cycles when it comes to the Earth (such as the evaporation/condensation/hydrometeor/runoff part of the water cycle), biological cycles when it comes to life cycles alone (life cycle of a mosquito, for example, or humus cycle) and biogeochemical cycles when the raw material comes into play with the living.

The biotic resources resulting from the life cycles are those provided by ecosystems (the life cycles of the biosphere), as opposed to abiotic resources, provided by the non-living.
We can mention forests, animals (birds, fish, ...), terrestrial and marine organisms, moss, mushrooms, yeasts, etc.

This therefore also includes direct derivatives (coffee, infusions, sugars, many drugs, machined wood, wood paper, alcohols, acetic acid, etc.).

The sum of those actors form a trophic web broken down into: producers (autotrophs, producers of organic matter from mineral matter: chlorophyllous plants, cyanobacteria and sulfur bacteria), consumers (primary heterotrophs: herbivores, and secondary: carnivores), decomposers (reducing agents: moulds, bacteria, etc.), detritivores (bacteria, fungi, flies, worms, etc.).

Once the bases of life appeared on Earth and the physical conditions became calmer, the first biological organisms (living and organized) resulting from the first complex molecules could appear.

The first organisms were unicellular, but also prokaryotes (cell without nucleus). Then appeared photosynthesis, multicellular organisms (metazoans), life without oxygen, then with the latter, then the release of water, eukaryotes (cells with nucleus), then sexualization, symbioses, ... Not everything did happen all at once, and major catastrophes took place: late heavy bombardment, great oxidation event, 5 major mass extinctions...

27
Following the stabilization of the Earth system, and the living conditions on its surface for the first organisms, life literally exploded: the number of species began to grow much more strongly. The living erratically continues to be a chaotic permanent laboratory, where mutagenic effects (radiation or chemical compounds) break the bases of genetic memory to form others, of which only an infinitely small fraction is viable and has superior characteristics, and ends up reproducing.

Thus appeared mosses, ferns, mushrooms, lichens, the first animals (-750 Myr), seed plants, then flowers, the Cambrian explosion of life (-535 Myr), reptiles, dinosaurs, birds, mammals, primates, etc.

Nothing is ever finished, and if it seems impossible on our scale to perceive evolution (we appeared between 2.4 million years ago via homo rudensis and 300,000 years ago for homo sapiens), once we observe living things with very rapid population renewal, such as mosquitoes or bacteria, we have already been able to observe mutations (resistance to products supposed to kill them, for example).

APPEARANCE OF WATER ON EARTH
28

28
We do not yet have the exact terms of the appearance of water on Earth, following the formation of the stars known today, and around 4.4-4.5 billion years ago, but we are getting closer in addition to certainties as we narrow the range of probable scenarios.

The problem with water is that stellar radiation tends to break these molecules apart, so it is complex to imagine how this oxide (its name is dihydrogen monoxide) formed or remained stable on Earth.

One can imagine that the water would have formed in the original cloud of Earth, but that a part would have been protected from the radiations inside (unlike Venus, for example). Another hypothesis would be that the progressive crushing of external bodies (asteroids, etc.) containing water would have been in sufficient quantity to explain the presence of the latter. A final hypothesis would be that planets containing water came to mingle with our primitive planetary system. We can also imagine mixing all these hypotheses at the same time!

In the end, water now covers 70.9% of Earth's surface today.

MATTER
29

29
Matter is what occupies space and has mass. It has 4 known states: plasma, gaseous, liquid, solid. Anything that has mass is matter.

In the current particle physics model, it is made up of quarks and leptons, which form hadrons (essentially baryons like protons and neutrons formed from up and down quarks). We add to them the leptons which the electrons are.

These three objects form baryonic matter, the one with which we can interact (about 5% of the universe), plus primitive forms, today representing a minority because they violently annihilate on contact with this baryonic matter, called antimatter.

And for the rest… We assume 27% of so-called “dark” matter and 68% of so-called “dark” energy, barely detectable, but all that… Is only hypothetical at the present time. We will have to wait for the progress of our research to write the next page.

ENERGY
BATCH 3
Emmy Noether demonstrated (1918) that energy is not something tangible, nor in itself. "Pure energy" does not exist. Energy is a quantity that measures the capacity of a system to modify a state. It can be kinetic, potential, gravitational, electric, chromodynamic, nuclear, radiant, etc.

Energy is just a value that remains constant through all possible transformations of a system, and this number exists because the laws of physics do not vary over time.

In the current particle physics model, bosons are vectors of the 4 fundamental interactions (weak, strong, electromagnetic, gravitational) whose energy quantas they transport.

The first principle of thermodynamics says: "during any transformation, there is conservation of energy". On the other hand, in any theoretical non-ideal system, there are losses (example: an electric motor has a mechanical efficiency between 80% and 98%, where a heat engine remains, as for gasoline around 36% and as for diesel around 42%). We call the useful energy of a system exergy and the lost energy anergy.
We talk about primary energy when it is taken from the environment (oil), and final when it comes out of the circuit (turning on electric plates, etc.).

Current particle physics, based among other things on the standard model of particles, attempts to explain the relationships between waves and particles, between mass and matter, between matter and antimatter, as well as many other elements at the very beginning of being considered (such as dark energy or dark matter).

What interests us the most, at present, is that we deduce as best as possible the functioning and the origin of energy and matter, the foundations of everything. It is in particular the quantum associations of matter and energy which, assembled, have allowed the formation of matter at a higher level, as during primordial nucleosynthesis.

NUCLEOSYNTHESIS AND BARYOGENESIS
32

32
Baryogenesis refers to the formation of baryons, particles whose main representatives are protons and neutrons. It dates from the first fractions of a second of the primordial universe. Matter probably did not exist before that.

The nucleosynthesis that followed is the synthesis of atomic nuclei from these baryons by various nuclear reactions (capture of neutrons or protons, nuclear fusion, nuclear fission, spallation), possibly followed by radioactive disintegrations or spontaneous fission. It has 4 main origins:

1) Primordial nucleosynthesis dating from the first tens of minutes following the Big Bang. It is responsible for the formation of light nuclei.

2) Stellar nucleosynthesis taking place in stars, which mainly synthesize helium. At the end of their existence, stars also synthesize most of the elements between lithium and iron, then some of the elements heavier than iron.

Our universe is discovered a little more every day, we derive a great deal of the laws of physics from it. In particular the laws of thermodynamics, Ohm's law, the universal law of gravitation, ...

To the laws are added principles (postulates not yet being demonstrated) such as inertia, thermodynamics (again), or correspondence, as well as broader theories, such as special or general relativity, quantum mechanics, the standard model, the Big Bang, conservation of energy, mass, fluid dynamics, etc.

This work has made it possible to discover the behavior of energy, but also to identify energy vectors, making it possible to contain energy that can then be converted into mechanical work, heat, etc. We know, for example, electricity, the compression of air or oil, hydrogen, a liquid retained at altitude, etc.

These laws, principles, until proven otherwise, have no parliament to be voted on. They apply everywhere, all the time, and there is no getting around them. Any decision of civilizational orientation going against them will be physically doomed to failure.

Wind energy is nothing new: at the end of the 19th century more than 6 million wind turbines were running in the United States, it is in no way a new source of energy since we passed the era of simple windmills (dated to 700 BC).

Solar energy includes many considerations: the first being to better design buildings to make them energy neutral buildings (we find this standardized concept from the 1930s): positioning, verandas, windows and glazed surfaces, reflectance and albedo of materials, etc. The heat of solar radiation is one of the oldest known sources of energy, long before concentrated solar thermal and photovoltaics (excitation of atoms according to band theory), discovered in 1839.

Same goes for the heat of the center of the Earth (deep and surface geothermal energy), still very little used, or gravitation via hydroelectricity, still the largest so-called "renewable" source in the world. Be careful however: not all are equal, as some of these sources are controllable (hydroelectricity or geothermal energy) and assimilated to perpetual, while others are unequal (sunshine), predictable (tides) or unpredictable (wind), which will require storage to buffer usage, and an increase in installed power, not to mention the densification of the electrical network for diffuse energies. In any case, the means of capture are never definitive, and they will always have to be renewed, not to mention that they have a very low charge rate.

This hypothesis is defended by Herman Daly (1990). According to him, only the material flows of the economy that meet the following three conditions can be considered sustainable in material and energy terms:

	1) the rate of consumption of renewable resources must not exceed the rate of regeneration of these same resources,
	2) the rate of consumption of non-renewable resources must not exceed the rate at which renewable and sustainable substitutes can be developed,
	3) the rate of emission of pollution must not exceed the capacity of the environment to absorb and assimilate this pollution.

In this hypothesis, the stock of natural capital should not fall. Daly argues that natural capital and artificial capital are complementary and not substitutable. We therefore retain that the economy must be part of a social construction and not define it, and that the social construction cannot go beyond the Earth's biocapacity either.

Until recently, humans believed that all resources could be mined indefinitely without damaging the system as a whole. This has led to exploitation and many of the negative environmental externalities (e.g. loss of biodiversity, climate change, etc.) that the world faces today, summarized by the model of Johann Rockström (et al.) under form of 9 planetary limits not to be exceeded.

To theoretically remedy these problems, and in this purely economic hypothesis disconnected from physics, efforts have been made to find "simply" technological substitutes for the resources and services provided by nature. Efforts in this regard contribute to poor sustainability, or the idea that manufactured capital can replace natural capital.
We also use the term substitutability of capital.

This conception of sustainability is the one that prevails in many international organizations (United Nations, World Bank, WBCSD), but also in the European Union as in the USA and most rich countries.

The indicator proposed by the Stiglitz Commission, adjusted net savings, makes the three forms of capital interchangeable: "economic" (derived from production), "human" (dealt with via education expenditure alone), "natural" (limiting ecological damage to climatic aspects only). This indicator is therefore always placed in a low sustainability model.

CLIMATE CHANGE

Probably the most well-known and debated planetary boundary of the Rockström model, climate change refers to the impact of human activities on the climate (land alteration, deforestation, greenhouse gas emissions, etc.). The last time atmospheric CO2 levels were this high was 2 million years ago. In California, we have just measured 50.5°C in 2022.

About 74% of humans will be exposed to deadly heat waves more than 20 days a year by the end of the 21st century if the current trajectory is not changed. The implications of profound climate change number in the thousands. Through his activities, man releases gases into the atmosphere (CO2, CH4, N2O, fluorinated gases, etc.) whose properties are to be opaque to thermal infrared and transparent to visible radiation, causing radiative forcing, modifying the Earth's energy balance. More heat is retained, and the average temperature has increased, since the Industrial Revolution started, by about +1.1°C.

In order not to exceed the objective of the IPCC (the organization fairly mandated by the UN to specifically collect the scientific literature published around this planetary limit) of the maximum of +2°C in 2100, it would be necessary to leave underground the 3/4 proven fossil fuel reserves. In the meantime, the damage is counted every day and affects all the countries of the world, more and more strongly every day.

DISRUPTION OF BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES

39
A biogeochemical cycle is the process of transport and cyclic transformation of a chemical element or compound between the major abiotic reservoirs, which are the geosphere, the atmosphere, the hydrosphere, and the biotic reservoirs, which is the biosphere.
In other words, the circulation between the inert and the living.

The most important cycles are the cycle of nitrogen, of carbon, of water, the cycle of hydrogen, of oxygen, of phosphorus, of selenium, of silicon, of underwater mercury, of sulfur, ocean salinity and circulation, and the metal cycles.

Humans strongly disrupt these cycles, such as those of phosphorus and nitrogen (human dejecta ending up in natural waters, as well as runoff linked to agriculture). Over-enriching waterways in this way is called eutrophication (asphyxiation following abnormal growth of living organisms). This planetary limit, for phosphorus and nitrogen, has been easily crossed, it is urgent to go down to levels that can be assimilated by living organisms (bacteria). We could also add the carbon cycle, analyzed separately… In climate change.

DISRUPTION OF LAND USE

Soils are formed from long processes, transformation of rocks from the soil of the Earth's crust into clays by disintegration of silicate polyhedra by hydrometeors (erosion), then this "skin" serves as a base for bacteria, then for plants, which at in turn die and return these elements to the ground, forming a humus.

They are gradually transformed for human needs, mainly for agricultural uses. Only 22% of the total land surface is arable (cultivable). And 200 hectares are cleared every day for the benefit of the cities.

About 20% of the emerged lands have not been greatly and negatively impacted by human activity: disappearance of vegetation in several forms (0.6% to 1% per year being deforested), rise of underground salts making the land on the surface arid, memory effect of substances such as pesticides, change in albedo (light reflectance of soils), etc.

Thawing of permafrost is 50 times faster than expected. It releases methane (CH4), 23 times more intense than CO2 in the greenhouse effect. This limit therefore also impacts other limits, such as the water cycle and therefore freshwater resources, biogeochemical cycles, or climate change.

Each year, 80,000 km² of forest disappear.
Only less than 50% of the trees that the Earth had before the arrival of agriculture 12,000 years ago remain.

Fresh water represents 2.5% of the total water on Earth, of which 4/5 is in the ice and only 1% on the surface and in the atmosphere. It is used absolutely everywhere, for everything from mining to health, industry, agriculture, etc.

1 in 9 people use drinking water from unsafe sources. 2.4 billion people live without water sanitation (300,000 child deaths per year). 1.8 billion people still drink water contaminated with faeces, causing 502,000 deaths from diarrhea each year.

Every day, 2 million tons of sewage and other effluents flow into the waters of the planet. UN studies show that within a few years, less than half the world will have access to little or no usable water (more than a third are already concerned).

The melting of the glaciers will bring in far too much fresh water, far too quickly, causing a change in the landscape, circulating mercury -frozen for the moment-, and if the remaining 30 million square kilometers of glaciers melt, the sea level will rise 84 meters. Around 52% of the world's population will live in areas with less water by 2050, displacing 24 to 700 million people. 60 countries will be highly to very highly water stressed by 2040.

70% of freshwater is used for agriculture in the world.
In one day, up to 11 billion tons of melting ice have been reported in Greenland alone.

NEW POLLUTING ENTITIES

This is the most emblematic and known pollution, chemical pollution and new polluting entities. Emissions of toxic and long-lived substances such as synthetic organic pollutants, heavy metal compounds, and radioactive materials represent some of the major man-made changes to the planetary environment. These compounds can have potentially irreversible effects on living organisms and on the physical environment (by affecting atmospheric processes and climate).

This limit is not yet clearly quantified, but we are sure that we need to estimate it. Trade on the global market includes about 350,000 different types of manufactured chemicals, or "new entities": pesticides, antibiotics, plastics (90 million tonnes per year, 10% of which lands in the oceans, accumulating in 5 to 7 huge gyres where the currents meet, concentrating about 18,000 pieces per square kilometer), industrial chemical products, ...

An adult ingests up to 52,000 microparticles of plastic per year (wear and tear on shoes, tires, bags, packaging, etc.), to which are added an additional 90,000 if they only drink bottled water (and 4,000 if preferring tap water), about one credit card volume per week. The production of human waste will increase by around 70% in the next ten years. 98% of pesticides reach at least one other entity than their original purpose required.

REGRESSION OF THE ATMOSPHERIC OZONE LAYER

The ozonosphere is a part of the atmosphere rich in ozone (O3, about 10 ppm), formed from oxygen, among others.

In the spectrum of electromagnetic waves emitted by the Sun, the wavelengths of ultraviolet rays, from 200 to 400 nm, are included between those of X-rays and those of visible radiation. The different types of ultraviolet rays depend on their wavelengths (UVA, UVB, UVC), and all are very intense mutagens, therefore sources of cancer and aggravation of cancer, among other risks. The main absorbers in the ultraviolet are nitrogen, oxygen, dioxygen and ozone, the latter being effective over the whole spectrum, even if it does not absorb everything.

Computer models predict that a 10% decrease in stratospheric ozone concentration could cause 300,000 skin cancers, 4,500 melanomas and between 1.60 million and 1.75 million more cases of cataracts each year worldwide. When UVB and UVA hit the skin, they cause keratinocytes (sunburn), which are actually cells that die of cell death due to DNA damage, and a health time bomb, even if UV rays also allow the body to transform provitamin D into vitamin D.

By monitoring its presence, it was established in the 1980s that the depletion of stratospheric ozone at the level of the south pole, commonly called “world's ozone hole”. From the end of the 20th century, the development of industry and transport, the intensity of agricultural activities and other human activities released quantities of nitrogenous, nitrated and chlorinated products (in particular chlorofluorocarbons) sufficient to disturb the balance of this layer, reinforcing the ozone destruction reaction and leading to a significant reduction in its concentration. If today we consider that we have acted in a corrective way and that this "hole" has stopped growing, it will take a few more decades to return to the levels before the end of the 20th century. And be careful not to do it again.

OCEAN ACIDIFICATION

Anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide can end up, like almost all gases, in the atmosphere, or be captured by so-called carbon sinks: 45% end up in the atmosphere, 30% in soils and plants and 24% in the oceans (the remaining fraction goes into non-plant living). We add the runoff of anthropogenic nitrogen compounds (agriculture) towards the oceans and the sulfur compounds resulting from combustion.

When these elements are trapped by the oceans by solubility or dilution, this has the effect of reducing the pH of the latter, which therefore becomes slightly more acidic. However, plankton is very sensitive to these changes (like the human body, which must remain between 7.35 and 7.45 -at 6.8, you would already be in a coma-) and marine ecosystems are already threatened, and not only the coral. From 1751 to 2004, the pH of ocean surface waters decreased from 8.25 to 8.14 (30%).

Aerosols affect cloud formation and atmospheric circulation patterns, such as monsoon systems in tropical regions. They also modify the amount of solar radiation reflected or absorbed in the atmosphere, and some are toxic and directly cause health problems. Humans affect the aerosol load through pollution and land use change which increases the release of dust and smoke. It has not been possible to set a specific threshold value at which global effects will occur.

The majority of aerosols reach the atmosphere by natural means: condensed salt from ocean waters, fine sand from desert dust storms, ice crystals above the poles and ash from fires or eruptions… Humans represent 10% of the global aerosol load, mainly concentrated in the northern hemisphere.

Black carbon (the most basic paracrystalline form of carbon) and sulfur dioxide are emitted from power plants and industrial smokestacks, while hydrocarbons are emitted from car exhaust and stratospheric vapor crystals from aircraft engines.

Aerosols also block about a third of global warming.

DECREASING VIABILITY ON EARTH

If there is no doubt today that the planet would continue to host life, which appeared, let us remember, from the inert, and this regardless of the extent of the anthropogenic damage, on the other hand, two key questions remain:

First: what is the direction taken? Is it viable or not? And on what horizon? Is the inertia of the impacted living system of the order of a decade, a century, worse?

Second: for bad decisions of the past and present, how resilient is the biosphere? The CO2 emitted into the atmosphere, for example, will remain there for around 10,000 years. 80, at least, to let half of it be absorbed back into the Earth system. Another example: soils destroyed by mining are destroyed for several hundred or even thousands of years.

In the meantime, each year, humans kill an average of 1,000 billion animals.
And human existence is only a symbiosis between the living human and the living non-human: if the rest dies, we die with the rest.

POLLUTION

Pollution can take many forms.

"Pollution" means anything that the environment or the ecosystem is not yet ready to reuse, recycle, insert into its existing cycles. Instead of being part of a cycle, the action degrades or even disintegrates the latter, which is not yet adapted and leaves the product as it is, because nothing is done to support it. Early Earth was an incredibly more polluted world than ours today.

The living always adapts (worms capable of digesting polystyrene have been discovered), but it needs time. Anything that goes faster than natural cycles will remain pollution, until it disappears through physical destruction, or adaptation of ecosystems. In the very long term, everything disappears.

9.3 million people die each year from the effects of pollution.
1 billion children are now exposed to serious health effects due to exposure to pollution.

"If there's one thing history teaches us, it's that there has never been an energy transition in the past." (Jean-Baptiste Fressoz)

When we look at the evolution of energy sources throughout history, humanity has never known how to move from one energy to another, nor from one material to another: it has simply accumulated new sources above the others, and recent revolutions such as "all electric" (however desirable) or digital do not help, quite the contrary (a smartphone contains on average about fifty very tightly alloyed metals). Apart from wars and supply shortages for political reasons, never such a thing as a transition has happened in history.

Today, at a time when we are talking about constant energy (light and therefore winds, gravity of rivers and tides, direct heat, etc.) or highly renewable energy (bioenergy, biofuels, etc.), it is important to remember that in a world at 85% fossil, 90% non-constant energy, all energies depend on each other, and therefore have neither sustainable substitute nor independence. You need oil, water for all the mines, from lithium to coal, you need coal to make the machines that use oil, you need electricity for the "all-electric" paradigm to come, you need fossil fuels and tons of materials to make solar panels, wind turbines, dams, and all the systems that, whatever happens, are not eternal and will have to be demolished and then made again, using resources not all infinite.

The traditional approach to common and political decision-making is to apply Taylorism to any element of society. Basically, it comes down to siloing the world and thinking of each problem as having an isolable solution, each taking care of its problem.

A system is any set of interconnected and mutually influencing variables. The systemic approach, developed over the past few decades, consists of taking the parameters as a whole and understanding their spatial complexities (details and mutual influences of the variables), unpredictable (chaos) and dynamic (variables linked by feedback loops).

This approach is very unintuitive for a human being, who will go more easily towards a heap of static parameters. Systems dynamics is the science of change, evolution, loops, interactions, linearities, stabilisations, etc. It is strongly rooted in mathematics and mass analysis (big data, automated learning, etc.). The Earth system is an extremely complex system, but possible to model, with increasing complexity (like the World3 model).
We already know multiple deductions to this approach.

RECYCLING AND DOWNCYCLING

Recycling starts from a supposedly sustainable principle of recovery, reprocessing, then separation for reuse of resources that are neither lost nor transformed (100% reused, on a given quantity). However, recycling simply consists in transforming a pollution… Into another pollution. And so on, until an acceptable pollution for the Earth system is obtained. Especially since on the one hand, after a while, certain materials decycle (can no longer be recycled via our known processes) and that in any case, we do not recycle half of what we use and disdains as waste, at best, in wealthier countries, for lacking of being able to collect (it's not just about objects: substances too, such as liquids like paint, toothpaste, etc.).
Once again, we are therefore on a formula destined to loss, intended to tend towards zero.

Recycling is not free, it also consumes a lot of resources, even if it is a much better solution than pushing extractivism to the limit, which would be deadly for the environment anyway. This would already be a damping factor of the worst.

Indeed, the inert like the living took millions of years to form over a layer of rock and the living started in the water. Uprooting the soil (the pedosphere) is to think that pedogenesis and abiogenesis would happen more quickly: this is not the case. When we have finished exploiting a mining site, what remains on the surface is unrecoverable on our scale and definitely pollutes.

MINE DEPLETION

Man has taken as many resources from the ground between 2002 and 2015 (1Tt) as a third of the total between 1900 and today, and as much over the last 70,000 years as it will take in the next 30, at the current rate. And hardware obsolescence, whether legitimate or planned (artificial) does not help. Out of 118 elements, including 86 metals, more than 80 are mined, twice as many as just 70 years ago, searching for element substitutes all the time.
We speak of mineral when the resource is identifiable, fairly homogeneous and crystallinely known, of rock when it is relatively heterogeneous and of ore when the rock contains enough of the mineral sought or co-extracted.

It is not only a question of extracting fossil fuels from the ground, it is indeed a question here of an overwhelming majority of the elements of Mendeleev's table, the quantities of which are finite within the thin part of lithosphere accessible in our limits. And all are coming to an end, one by one, except for aluminum, iron, magnesium, titanium and manganese. Some elements only have proven and exploitable reserves for a handful of decades. And with the pressure of the mirage of a "transition" from fossil to all-electric (thus metallic), the most used materials will see their extraction multiplied, everything sinking faster... Towards a definitive and imminent shortage. In the meantime, more and more rock has to be extracted for less and less material, as historically we started with the easiest and most abundant deposits. It is estimated that more than 40 elements are already in danger of being supplied… To speak only of the chemical elements alone. The calculation is dynamic and to be related to the contemporary economy at the time of the calculation, which explains that depending on the R/P ratio (reserves at a given time / production rate at this time) the number of remaining years varies (we increase energy cost and amount of ground mined to maintain rates).
 
Not sure that there is enough left for everything we do today, nor especially for how long, including hospitals, renewable energies, transport, domestic, food, education, digital services, justice, civil protection, management of natural disasters, building, artisans, not to mention all the totally superfluous and macrocephalic part of what we produce...

ABUNDANT ENERGY CONCENTRATIONS

Concentrated and abundant energies -such as fossil fuels and even more nuclear energy- means that the effort required to extract, transport and use them is all the more reduced and the product of their use much stronger. In order, nuclear energy, fossil fuels (then to a lesser extent hydroelectricity, biomass, then the rest) have been incredible facilitators and development vectors.

It is thanks to these characteristics that humanity has been able to make a leap forward: compactness, dangerousness, malleability, ease of extraction, transportability, appearance and shape, etc.

Today, if we were to replace non-human mechanical force with human mechanical force, we would have to... Be 200 times more on the planet, of which 99.5% of humans would be full-time slaves. Much more so in rich countries. Man thus provides at the maximum of their capacities less than 0.5% of what they consumes, smoothed over a life, and it gets worse and worse. Suffice to say that we are addicted to abundant energy.

The historical stability of the interglacial period in which we are (the Holocene, for 11,500 years) also helps a lot, in particular to become sedentary then. More recently, the discovery and advent of techniques for the extraction and industrialization of abundant energy sources has resulted in an incredible boom in human progress and development. Before that time, the Earth only had 0.5 billion inhabitants.

Humans have been using fossil fuels for thousands of years, some originally outcropping, but it is widely believed that it was Edwin Drake's 1859 petroleum engineering work at Titusville that changed the face of the world and laid the foundations of this modern era.

The most developed countries then passed from an agrarian economy to an economy of production of goods and services, leading to an explosive use of the resources thus discovered.
Steam engine, railroad boom, internal combustion engine, telephony, pasteurization, dynamo, light bulb, nuclear physics, computing, quantum physics… Everything we were born with today and what we are used to comes from there.

The thermo-industrial revolutions generated a new chimera: the idea that any development of our civilization suffered no limit. This is also the basis of any liberal idea (freedom taking precedence and regulation having to be minimal, to the detriment of everything else) not to say capitalistic (the lucrative and infinite vocation of capital regardless of what feeds it, assumed to be non-determining, hence infinite).

The economic theories which then resulted from this, known as "neoclassical", have as their dominant thought that the resources at our disposal would be infinite. We now know (and have for a long time, to tell the truth) that this is false. Economic growth is only an exact reflection of the growth in the use of earth's resources and therefore of pollution. With 10% growth, we would have to consume the equivalent of the energy radiated from the Sun in less than 180 years, and in less than 1,000 years, all of the energy of the stars in the universe.

To engulf ourselves again in these obsolete theories is to condemn ourselves to a civilizational collapse…
In the meantime, both global and individual global GDP is strictly proportional to energy consumption, and even more strongly overcoupled to material extraction, and therefore to pollution.

IMPROVEMENT OF LIFE AND USES

Through scientific and technical progress, we live better, we focus more on things that give meaning to a life. We are born better, we live better, we suffer less, we drive away poverty in all its forms, we die less, we live longer. Thus, the population increases, and lifestyles change.

It is unthinkable to go back. Nothing was better before, it's a myth destroyed by history and facts. Life expectancy was 25 to 30 years just 4 centuries ago. And the sufferings were infinitely greater, the life miserable, short and hard.

On the other hand, improving the quality of life today amounts to increasing the use of resources: matter, energy, machines, robots, automata, network, information... In the end, it is all the underlying human activity that explodes, replacing human strength and time with something else.

Despite appearances, the decisive issues facing humanity do not come from too large a population. This idea denotes a liberal and accountable vision of human development. Especially since the emergency exceeds life expectancy and would involve genocide, deadly pandemics, devastating wars or dramatic famines, waiting for natural deaths by lowering the birth rate would be too long.

Of course, we can think that fewer people equal less consumption, but dividing the population by two at random, for example, just amounts to doubling (approximately) the time we have. Going from 30 to 60 does not change anything, and concerns the same generations, to face the same problems.

Especially since if you look closely, the richer you are on a planetary scale, the more responsible you are. Eliminating the poorest 2/3 (5.4 billion people) amounts to eliminating… Barely 20% of pollution.

The world, divisible into countries or regions, is following a very specific demographic evolution, called demographic transition. Through this evolution, we observe a drop in the number of children per woman of childbearing age, a drop in mortality, then a drop in the birth rate. When human beings live well, they have fewer children. Demographers expect a projection of around 10 to 12 billion human beings on Earth once this transition is complete. We simply need to remember that the way of life in rich countries is not viable, neither for others… Nor for themselves.

The rebound effect, first described by William Stanley Jevons in 1865, refers to the total increase in resources consumed despite technological and technical progress, because the latter make what they improve more accessible. It designates a systemic response to a change.

Basically, for example, when we make vehicles cheaper and more efficient, we end up with a larger fleet in circulation, with which people individually drive more per day, increases the number of vehicles per person and the uses.

It can be direct (reduction in purchase and/or usage costs leading to more usage, substitution effect), indirect (idem, but leading to more usage of other goods and services), or structural (multiple declines leading to new types of production).

Degrowth is not decline, neither is it recession nor collapse. Degrowing is realizing that humans have never been in this recent period on an infinite coast of prosperity, but in a historical parenthesis consisting in burning faster -too quickly- the easy resources at their disposal. Degrowth is not chaotic self-destruction, it is a social project.

Scientific progress has no reason to stop, and society has no reason to erode. It can continue, on the condition of reviewing absolutely all the global thought logic, well beyond the "transitions", or the substitutes. This time, technology will not be able to overcome physics. This time, the miracle will not take place: technical progress is outpaced by uses.

"Utopia has changed sides: today a utopian is someone who believes that everything can go on as before." (Pablo Servigne)

CIVILIZATIONAL COLLAPSE
60

60
The most complicated thing for rich countries, especially so-called Western economies -less so for others- is to project themselves into the idea that two centuries of explosive (almost) continuous growth can suffer a limit, an asymptote, an end.

On March 2, 1972, researchers at MIT built a system dynamics analysis model called "World". This model evolved into a more viable model, called "World3". From this system, they launched simulations and published a report called "The limits to growth", sold 30 million copies, in 30 languages, and which still is a main reference 50 years later.
To date, from the corrected variables, and retesting the system for micro-corrections every decade, the conclusions remain the same since the beginning:

1) "If current trends of growth in world population, industrialization, pollution, food production and resource depletion continue, the limits of growth on this planet will be reached within the next hundred years. The most likely result will be a rather sudden and uncontrollable decline in population and industrial capacity."
  2) "It is possible to alter these growth trends and establish a condition of ecological and economic stability that is sustainable into the future. [...]"
   3) "If the people of the world decide to strive for this second result rather than the first, the sooner they begin to work towards it, the greater their chances of success."

And since ? When we trace the realities which happened from known values on the hypothetical curves of this report, we inevitably arrive at a model very close to reality over 50 years, and of incredible precision.
And a collapse… Somewhere between 2030 and 2050, closer to the second than the first.

CRITICALITY OF A SOCIETY CHOICE
61

61
We arrived a long time ago in a transitional period, and we are faced with a societal choice: anticipate the fall by a decrease, or watch our civilization collapse. It's time to put on the table what we want.
All the developments resulting from social struggles have been made possible by this sudden abundance: holidays, retirement, reduced working hours, inclusion, weekends, non-religious holidays, vacations, free time, abolition of slavery, serfdom, human rights, of children, of women, of non-human animals, reducing misery and suffering, etc. If the Human Development Index (HDI) was continuously rising, it's a safe bet that this abundance had something to do with it.
The shadow of the past still lurks.
 
It is time to realize that the crossing of these planetary limits only reflects symptoms, of which we are the origin of the disease, and to realize that we must completely review our software of thought, all of our activities and of our common goal: lasting happiness.

At this stage, as Arthur Keller says, "now, it's the catch or the crush".

BATCH 6

RESILIENCE OF HUMANITY
62

62
Since the dawn of time, human, through their neocortex, have been able to project themselves and imagine futures. The future must be sustainable, after a strong planned decline. Which is in truth the historical period from which we come out, but this one was not acceptable for all that.

We must find sustainable ways to meet basic needs (sleep, breathe, drink, eat, dispose of, protect ourselves thermally, be safe) but also to develop a society that can prosper, anticipate, resist, and in which progress can continue, within the limits of what is within reach, socially, for all.

This is the whole issue of critical awareness that is in question today.
Allowing a society which recovers in the event of a crisis, which anticipates and develops by adopting fair principles, a search for happiness, and, why not, one day, an abstraction of primitive animal constraints (birth, suffering, death, reproduction, competition , primary needs, …) which are ultimately the cause of all the evils of the world.

REGENERATION OF THE LIVING
63

63
Regeneration refers to the ability of a system, at any scale, to repair itself after suffering damage, including that of an entire ecosystem.
After mineral transformation, the main axis of regeneration is often photosynthesis. A strong durability would lead to the regeneration of what can still be and which has not disappeared.

Often invasive species return first, then follows a progressive ecological succession, until an optimal stability, which can take decades, or even more... Provided that the external parameters have remained viable (climate, soils, nutrients, movements animals, low pollution, etc.), in order to achieve homeostasis (beneficial maintenance of key factors), its climax.

GEOPOLITICAL STABILIZATION
64

64
If everyone gets involved simultaneously, and without waiting for another, if everyone acts for themselves, without expecting congratulations, and puts an end to illusory competitiveness, then the world give itself a chance to stabilize.

The barriers are above all geographical, which induces cultural barriers, which create linguistic barriers. These barriers can be broken down and allow everyone to realize how extremely identical human beings are and how their lives are intertwined.
To cultivate withdrawal is to cultivate the over-differentiation of populations, of individuals.
Cultivating synergy, solidarity, otherness, mutual aid means giving yourself a chance. The world seen through the prism of another is not the same world.

"Unite! Practice mutual aid! This is the surest way to give each and everyone the greatest security, the best guarantee of existence and of physical, intellectual and moral progress." (Peter Kropotkin)
GEOPOLITICAL STABILIZATION
BATCH 6

TERRITORIAL STRUCTURAL REORGANIZATION
65

65
When transportation is atrophied, reorganization takes place at local level. And it is geography more than history that will determine the limits of these citizen territories.

When global economy fails, based on false predicates and untenable promises, local pragmatism will prevail.

When liberal and capitalist doctrines validate the idea that the appropriation of the resources of some can be done indefinitely to the detriment of others and of biocapacity, it is the ethical collective that will have to prevail, probably at the cost of struggles, the most dominant ones not realizing that they are a source of aggravation and that they would take everything with them.

When the market economy and production based on supply and demand become disconnected from the reality of physical flows, it is the society based on needs that will have to take precedence. Choosing degrowth means choosing a social and political reorganization on a chosen scale and scope.

DECREASE IN HUMAN SURVIVAL
66

66
As strange as it may seem, it is almost impossible to completely eradicate humans from planet Earth (apart from military scenarios of self-destruction, if any).

Bringing human survival back down means bringing it to a pre-industrial level of consumption, minus the resources exploited in the meantime, minus the lost biocapacity, minus the individual know-how temporarily lost, increased by the knowledge accumulated since.

The human population was just under a billion in 1800, in a world already not fully sustainable, but much closer to planetary boundaries. In Europe, life expectancy had just risen to about 35 years.

When a resource, whichever it is, is lacking in relation to a need (and arbitrarily to a desire), we speak of scarcity. A collapse of the dynamics of a civilization can lead to such events. In general, shortages over-aggravate situations.

They have devastating systemic effects: the slightest disruption announced, propagated, or observation can create absolutely irrational behavior, going as far as the most serious one. In a world that has cultivated the separation of responsibilities, private enterprise, borders, excessive individualism, the consequences can be disastrous. The meager appearance of a simple virus like SARS-COV-2 in 2019 has shown the perverse effects that there can be in disconnecting individuals and tearing the social fabric apart, directly (shelves emptied without reason, shortages and thefts of protective masks, shortages of gold and banknotes, of freezers) to indirectly (production of semiconductors, therefore digital, game consoles, kettlebells, building materials).

So project yourself and imagine a definitive lack of resources…

In the meantime, with each passing day, given the current trajectory, there is a strong risk of seeing new shortages arrive, one by one, increasingly long and impactful. It is up to us to lead the world by need.

WITHDRAWAL, CONFLICTS, WARS
68

68
Rising of the far right, temptations of absolute order, repression, censorship, segregation, press harassment, fascism, totalitarianism, national movements, designation of scapegoats, xenophobia, allophobia... As soon as a situation involves pain, incomprehension, suffering or death, the first physiological and social reflex is to withdraw, towards a survivalist and individualist vision, solitarily.

When the causes are invisible, imagination takes over, and crisis management habits through minimization and rapidly searching for causes and solutions, too. Managerial vision has finished destroying the long-term analysis.

This is what we must avoid at all costs. What is apparently a solution is in truth an aggravation of the phenomena: conflicts, retreats, rejections, wars have an energetic and material cost well beyond the healthy mechanisms of a civilization.

But what to do when we are collectively being and holding the causes, effects and solutions?

This workshop is greatly inspired by its big brother: the Climate Fresk workshop, created by Cédric Ringenbach, to whom it probably owes everything. However, it is more complex.It is also inspired by numerous works, in particular the public involvements of personalities such as Arthur Keller, Jean-Marc Jancovici, Aurore Stéphant, Philippe Bihouix, Johan Rockström, Emma Haziza, Valérie Masson-Delmotte, Aurélien Barrau, Catherine Wolfram, Jean-Baptiste Fressoz, as well as many organizations, from the UN (IRP, IPCC, UNESCO, etc.) to the Shift Project via the Club of Rome, its report The Limits To Growth (Meadows), the European Union, the IEA, Négawatt, the WWF, GreenPeace, EIA, Global Footprint Network and many more people and organizations, the list is fatally too long. These people and entities have in no way supported, participated in, or endorsed this workshop.
This workshop in no way exempts, but on the contrary encourages participation, even involvement, in all the other existing workshops of this type (and there are many of them!).It is more than recommended to become an animator of The Climate Fresk at least to animate it, and to train beforehand (videos on YouTube can help you).
