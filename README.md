# The Earth System Fresco Slides
All the workshop slides, this repository is here to help better contribute on texts and translations.

## Purpose
This repository is here to maintain slide sources (texts and images).
This doesn't straight update the website publicly accessible slides (the rest of the process has to be done manually).

## Contributing
All contributions are welcome!
Any language translation is welcome, the more the fresco is translated, the more it gets famous!

If you speak multiple languages but have limited time, you should consider most spoken languages first.
